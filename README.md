\##  **Problem Statement Overview**

This assignment simulates real-world Git workflows used in enterprise environments at XYZ Corporation. It covers:

\- Repository setup and collaboration

\- GitFlow branching strategy

\- Merge conflict resolution

\- Release management and tagging

\- Hotfix handling

\- Advanced Git operations (stash, cherry-pick, rebase, squash)

\- Continuous Integration (CI) concepts

\- Auditing and debugging with Git



---



\##  **Solution Approach**

I completed all tasks as per the instructions. Below is a summary:



\### \*\*Part 1: Initial Setup\*\*

\- \*\*Task 1:\*\* Initialized and cloned repositories using `git clone`.

\- \*\*Task 2:\*\* Forked and cloned an open-source project.



\### \*\*Part 2: Branching \& Feature Development\*\*

\- \*\*Task 3:\*\* Created `develop` branch and feature branches (`feature/login`, `feature/conflict-demo`, `feature/stash-demo`).

\- \*\*Task 4:\*\* Committed changes and pushed feature branches for PR review.

\- \*\*Task 5:\*\* Resolved merge conflicts between `develop` and feature branches.



\### \*\*Part 3: Releases \& Tags\*\*

\- \*\*Task 6:\*\* Created a tag `v1.0` for the first release.

\- \*\*Task 7:\*\* Created a `hotfix/security` branch for critical production bug fix.



\### \*\*Part 4: Team Operations\*\*

\- \*\*Task 8:\*\* Used `git stash` to save work in progress and restored it later.

\- \*\*Task 9:\*\* Cherry-picked urgent fixes into the current branch.



\### \*\*Part 5: Continuous Integration\*\*

\- Configured concept for CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions for automated testing).



\### \*\*Part 6: Advanced Git\*\*

\- \*\*Task 11:\*\* Demonstrated `git rebase` vs `git merge` for a clean history.

\- \*\*Task 12:\*\* Squashed multiple commits into one before merging feature branches.



\### \*\*Part 7: Auditing\*\*

\- \*\*Task 13:\*\* Used `git blame` to identify commit authors for debugging.
